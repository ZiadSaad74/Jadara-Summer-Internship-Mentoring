# Jadara Summer Internship Mentoring Repository

- Welcome to my repository as a mentor on a team in the summer internship for Jadara Solutions.

- This repository was created as part of an internship program in our company, where I worked as a mentor guiding a team of interns across different roles:

1- Business Analyst

2- Data Modellers

3- ETL Data Engineers

4- Semantic & Data Visualization Specialists

- The goal of this repo is to provide a complete view of the project journey: from documentation templates, to weekly evaluations, to the teamâ€™s final deliverables, think of it as a one-stop reference for everything we built and tracked during the 9-week internship.
