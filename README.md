# Jadara Summer Internship Mentoring Repository

- Welcome to my repository as a mentor on a team in the summer internship for Jadara Solutions.

- This repo was created as part of an internship program, where I worked as a mentor guiding a team of interns across different roles:

  - Business Analyst
  - Data Modellers
  - ETL Data Engineers
  - Semantic & Data Visualization Specialists

- The goal of this repo is to provide a complete view of the project journey: from documentation templates, to weekly evaluations, to the teamâ€™s final deliverables, think of it as a one-stop reference for everything we built and tracked during the 9-week internship.


# ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure:

## 1. Documentation Templates

- This folder contains the templates we used throughout the project.
- Inside the folder you will find:

    - BRD - Template.docx â†’ Base template for the Business Requirements Document (BRD).
    - VRD - Template.docx â†’ Template for the Visual Requirements Document (VRD).
    - Mapping Sheet - template.xlsx â†’ Used to map source fields to target data structures.
    - Meeting minutes - template.docx â†’ Designed for team leaders to fill after each meeting and upload it for the rest of the team as a reference to has a shared recap continuously.

    - Weekly report for members - template.docx â†’ Weekly reporting structure for each team member.
    - Weekly report for team leader - template.docx â†’ Weekly reporting structure for the team leader.

- These templates standardized the teamâ€™s work, ensuring consistency across documentation and reporting.
  
## 2. Team Evaluation

- This folder holds the weekly evaluations that I conducted as a mentor over the 9 weeks of training. Both the dataset and the dashboards here were updated every week to track the teamâ€™s progress.

- Inside the folder you will find:

  - Team 3 evaluation.csv â†’ The raw evaluation sheet (data collected weekly).
  - Team 3 evaluation.pbix â†’ Power BI dashboard built on top of the evaluation data.
  - Evaluation summary.png â†’ Screenshot of the first page of the evaluation dashboard.
  - Evaluation report.png â†’ Screenshot of the second page of the dashboard.

- It shows how performance was measured and visualized across the internship. The CSV is the input, while the PBIX and screenshots show the analysis results.

## 3. Teamâ€™s Actual Documentations

- This is the main deliverables folder, the actual project outputs created by the team.
- It includes everything: final documentation, data mapping, measures, and dashboards (both in PBIX format and screenshots).

  - Final Project Documentation.pdf â†’ Complete final project report including all project processes (Business analysis details - ETL processes - Data modellers works - Semantic analysis works - Visualization details).

  - Team project BRD.pdf â†’ Final business requirements document of the project.
  - Team project VRD.pdf â†’ Final visual requirements document of the project.
  - Mapping sheet.xlsx â†’ Actual source-to-target mapping used.
  - Measures.xlsx â†’ Defined measures and KPIs needed in the business and defined in BRD.
  - Final dashboard.pbix â†’ Full Power BI dashboard inlcuding all the analysis results of KPIs discussed and defined.
  - Time performance (dark & light).jpg â†’ Dashboard page showing performance over time.

Location performance (dark & light).jpg â†’ Dashboard page showing performance by location.

Sales performance (dark & light).jpg â†’ Dashboard page showing sales KPIs.

Detailed report (dark & light).jpg â†’ Drill-down report page.

Summary statistics (dark & light).jpg â†’ Dashboard summary page.

ðŸ”‘ Why this folder matters: It represents the final implementation â€” how the team connected business requirements, data modeling, ETL pipelines, and visualization into one complete solution.

ðŸš€ How to Explore This Repo

Start with Documentation Templates to see the base structures the team followed.

Move to Team Evaluation to understand how performance was tracked over the 9 weeks.

Finally, check Teamâ€™s Actual Documentations to explore the real project deliverables (BRD, VRD, reports, PBIX dashboards, and screenshots).

ðŸŽ¯ Why This Repo Exists

This repo is not just about deliverables â€” itâ€™s also about showing the process:

How a team of interns was guided using structured templates.

How performance was monitored and improved weekly.

How all roles came together to deliver a real-world project.

Itâ€™s a reference point for future interns, mentors, or anyone who wants to see how structured training, evaluation, and project execution can come together in one place.
